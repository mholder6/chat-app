# chat-app
To use these scripts as a chat application, first run the **server.py** script,
and then from another terminal or machine, run the **client.py** script. The 
client will prompt the user to enter their name, and then the client will be
able to send and receive messages in the chat room. Please be aware that only
client users can communicate, and the server script provides the environment to
do so. -- the server cannot send messages, but can view the messages being sent 
by clients.
